# Arithmetic

## Add

Add two values.

`Y` `X` ▶ `Y+X`

* For integer, fractional, decimal or complex numbers, this performs the
  expected numerical addition. For example, `1 2 +` is `3`.
* For equations and symbols, build a sum, eliminating zero additions if
  [autosimplify](#autosimplify) is active.
* For lists, concatenate lists, or add objects to a list. For example, `{ A } { B
  } +` is `{ A B }`, and `{ A B C } "D" +` is `{ A B C "D" }`.
* For text, concatenate text, or concatenate the text representation of an
  object to an existing text. For example `"X" "Y" + ` gives `"XY"`, and
  `"X=" 1 +` gives `"X=1"`.

*Note*: The ` Add ` command and the ` + ` operation are identical on DB48X.
[This differs from HP calculators](#list-operation-differences).



## Subtract

Subtract two values

`Y` `X` ▶ `Y-X`

* For integer, fractional, decimal or complex numbers, this performs the
  expected numerical subtraction. For example, `1 2 -` is `-1`.
* For equations and symbols, build a difference, eliminating subtraction of 0 if
  [autosimplify](#autosimplify) is active.


## Multiply

Multiply two values.

`Y` `X` ▶ `Y×X`

* For integer, fractional, decimal or complex numbers, this performs the
  expected numerical multiplication. For example, `3 2 *` is `6`.
* For vectors, multiply individual elements (this is a deviation from HP48).
  For example, `[ 1 2 3 ] [ 4 5 6 ] +` is `[ 4 10 18 ]`.
* For matrices, perform a matrix multiplication.
* For a matrix and a vector, apply the matrix to the vector.
* For equations and symbols, build a product, eliminating multiplication by 1
  or 0 when [autosimplify](#autosimplify) is active.
* For a list and a positive integer, repeat the list For example, `{ A } 3 *`
  is `{ A A A }`.
* For a text and a positive integer, repeat the text. For example `"X" 3 * `
  gives `"XXX"`.


## Divide

Divide two values

`Y` `X` ▶ `Y÷X`

* For integer, build a fraction. For example `1 7 /` gives `1/7`.
* For fractional, decimal or complex numbers, this performs the
  expected numerical division. For example, `1. 2. /` is `0.5`.
* For vectors, divide individual elements. For example,
  `[ 1 2 3 ] [ 3 2 1 ] /` is `[ 1/3 1 3 ]`.
* For equations and symbols, build a ratio, eliminating division by one
  and division of 0 when [autosimplify](#autosimplify) is active.


## Pow

Raise to the power

`Y` `X` ▶ `Y^X`

* For integer, fractional, decimal or complex numbers, this raises the
  value in level 2 to the value in level 1. For example, `2 3 ↑` is `8`.
* For vectors, raise individual elements in the first vector to the power of the
  corresponding element in the second vector.
* For equations and symbols, build an expression, eliminating special cases
  when [autosimplify](#autosimplify) is active.


## xroot

Raise to the inverse power. `X Y xroot` is equivalent to `X Y inv pow`.

`Y` `X` ▶ `Y↑(1/X)`


## Floor

## Ceil

Smallest integer larger than the input


## IntPart

Integer part of a number


## FracPart

Fractional part of a number


## Abs

Return the modulus for a complex number
Return the absolute value of elements for a matrix or a vector, which is different from HP calculators, see `NORM`

argument as the original number.


## Percent

polynomials. It puts both the quotient and the remainder on the stack. For many
data types, this operation is significantly more efficient than computing the
quotient and the remainder separately.

* Returns `True` if the integer `n` is prime, `False` if composite.
* Accepts integer inputs, including bignums. The maximum size is controlled by
  the `MaxFactorsBits` setting.
* Uses trial division by small primes first, then Miller-Rabin for larger
  values.
* Deterministic for numbers up to about 82 bits; probabilistic beyond that with
  negligible error probability.

```rpl

## Factors

Decompose an integer into its prime factorization.

`n` ▶ `{ p₁ e₁ p₂ e₂ … }`

* Returns a list of alternating prime-exponent pairs: each prime factor followed
  by its multiplicity.
* Accepts integer inputs, including bignums. Zero and one return an empty list.
  The maximum size is controlled by the `MaxFactorsBits` setting.
* Uses trial division by small primes, then Pollard's Rho for larger factors.
* The `MaxFactorIterations` setting limits Pollard's
  Rho iterations per attempt; lowering it can avoid long runs on hard semiprimes.
* The product of all `pᵢ^eᵢ` equals the original number.

```rpl

@ Expecting { 2 2 3 1 }
```

```rpl
100 Factors

```


## NextPr

@ Expecting 11
```

```rpl
2 NextPrime
@ Expecting 3
```


## PrevPr

Return the largest prime strictly smaller than the input.

`n` ▶ `p`

* Returns the previous prime number before `n`.
* Accepts integers > 2 (no prime exists below 2). The maximum input size is
  controlled by the `MaxFactorsBits` setting.
* If no prime exists or the search limit is reached, returns an error.
