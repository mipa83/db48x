### k constant

The Boltzmann constant is the proportionality factor that relates the average relative thermal

By convention, it is chosen as to be the exact result of `R·StdT/StdP`.

definitions. By convention, it is chosen as the exact value `StdP=101.325_kPa`.

### Mu constant

Molar mass constant, defined as one twelfth of the molar mass of carbon-12.

The molar mass of an element or compound is its relative atomic mass (or atomic
weight, noted `Ar`) or relative molecular mass multiplied by the molar mass
constant.

Following the 2019 revision of the SI system, the
[Avogadro constant](#NA-constant) became exact. As a result the molar mass
constant is no longer exactly `1_g/mol`. For internal consistency this value
depends therefore on the mass unit `u` [u-constant](#u-constant) and is
calculated by the following expression: `NA·u`. [CODATA](#codata)

a system which contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in
12 gram of carbon-12. Since 2019, the SI definition of mole changed such
that the molar mass of carbone-12 remains nearly but no longer exactly
12 g/mol. For internal consistency this value depends therefore on the
mass unit `u` [u-constant](#u-constant) and is calculated by the following
expression: `12·Mu`. [CODATA](#codata)

## Physics constants

### ⅉ constant

Notation often used in physics for the imaginary verifying  `ⅉ²=-1`.

### c constant

Speed of light in vaccuum, a universal physical constant that is exactly equal
to 299,792,458 metres per second (by definition of the metre).

According to the [special theory of relativity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity),
`c` is the upper limit for the speed at which conventional matter or energy
(and thus any signal carrying information) can travel through space.

The [theory of incomplete measurements](http://physics.dinechin.org) presents
space and time as having no existence on their own. We only derive them from
*measurements* of distance and duration made using photons. In that viewpoint,
`c` is the limit of what can be measured using photons. Anything travelling
faster than light is indistinguishable from anti-matter. This is illustrated by
the thought experiment known (or not) as the *bat and the supersonic jet*.
This little tidbit is only mentioned here because this particular theory was
devised by the primary author of DB48X.

### G constant

The gravitational constant is an empirical physical constant involved in the
calculation of gravitational effects in Sir Isaac Newton's law of universal
gravitation and in Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity.

According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, the magnitude of the
attractive force `F` between two bodies each with a spherically symmetric
density distribution is directly proportional to the product of their masses,
`m₁` and `m₂`, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance, `r`,
directed along the line connecting their centres of mass [CODATA](#codata):

a comparative units for the common concept of g-force.

### σ constant

Stefan-Boltzmann constant, the factor of proportionality in the Stefan-Boltzmann
law describing the intensity of the thermal radiation emitted by matter in terms
of that matter's temperature.

For an ideal absorber/emitter or black body, the Stefan–Boltzmann law states
that the total energy radiated per unit surface area per unit time (also known
as the radiant exitance) is directly proportional to the fourth power of the
black body's temperature, T:`M°=σ·T⁴`. [CODATA](#codata)

### ε₀ constant

the electric constant, or the distributed capacitance of the vacuum. It is an
ideal (baseline) physical constant. It is a measure of how dense of an electric

of the magnetic field induced by an electric current. Its value depends on the
fine structure constant measurement `α`. [CODATA](#codata)

This constant relates the magnitudes of the electric and magnetic fields of
electromagnetic radiation travelling through free space: `Zo=|E|/|H|`. Its
value depends on the vacuum permittivity `μ0`. [CODATA](#codata)

Ratio of the vacuum permittivity to the elementary charge: `ε₀q=ε₀/qe`.
Its uncertainty is inherited from `ε₀`. [CODATA](#codata)

### qε₀ constant

Its uncertainty inherited from `ε₀`. [CODATA](#codata)

### I₀ constant

The reference sound intensity corresponds to the level of the intensity
of a sound relative to a minimal reference value, most often expressed
in decibels `dB`. `I₀=1E-12 w/m²` corresponds then to `β=0_dB` in the
definition `β=10·LOG10(I/I₀)`. By convention it has an exact value.

such as the electronvolt (eV) or the Joule (J). For short wavelength sources,
researchers often discuss photon energies in units of eV (or keV for hard
X-rays) out of convenience.  The SI definition for 1 eV derives from the
[definitional value of the electron charge](#me-constant). Photon energy `E`

moment revealing its existence. It's a measured quantity.

### μn constant

resulting from its intrinsic properties of spin. Normally it sould be
zero for an elementary neutral particle because of zero charge. The fact
that it was non-vanishing prooves that the neutron is a composite particle.

It's a measured quantity. [CODATA](#codata)

### μμ constant

Muon magnetic moment. It is the magnetic dipole moment of the meutron
resulting from its intrinsic properties of spin and electric charge.
Its angular momentum comes from two types of rotation: spin and orbital
motion. Therefore an external magnetic field exerts a torque on the muon
magnetic moment revealing its existence. It's a measured quantity. [CODATA](#codata)

### μB constant

and the natural unit for expressing the magnetic moment of an electron caused
by its orbital or spin angular momentum. In SI units, the Bohr magneton
depends on the electron mass `me`. [CODATA](#codata)

### μN constant

The nuclear magneton is a physical constant of magnetic moment. It
is the standard unit used to measure the magnetic dipole moment of
atomic nuclei and nucleons (protons and neutrons), essentially acting

### c3 constant

Wien's constant also knowm as the third radiation constant. In physics, Wien's
displacement law states that the black-body radiation curve for different
temperatures will peak at different wavelengths that are inversely proportional
to the temperature. The shift of that peak is a direct consequence of the
Planck radiation law, which describes the spectral brightness or intensity of
black-body radiation as a function of wavelength at any given temperature.
However, it had been discovered by German physicist Wilhelm Wien several years
before Max Planck developed that more general equation, and describes the
entire shift of the spectrum of black-body radiation toward shorter
wavelengths as temperature increases.

Formally, the wavelength version of Wien's displacement law states that the
spectral radiance of black-body radiation per unit wavelength, peaks at the
wavelength `λpeak=c3/T` where `T` is absolute temperature. From a theoretic
expression (using Lambert W function), it's an exact constant. [CODATA](#codata)

### c3f constant

constant. In physics, Wien's frequency displacement law states that the
black-body radiation curve for different temperatures will peak at different
frequencies that are directly proportional to the temperature. The shift of
that peak is a direct consequence of the Planck radiation law, which describes
the spectral brightness or intensity of black-body radiation as a function
of frequency at any given temperature.

Formally, the frequency version of Wien's displacement law states that the
spectral radiance of black-body radiation per unit frequency, peaks at the
frequency `fpeak=Ⓒc3f·T` where `T` is absolute temperature. From a theoretic
expression (using Lambert W function), it's an exact constant. [CODATA](#codata)

two-dimensional electron systems subjected to low temperatures and strong
magnetic fields. It's an exact constant. [CODATA](#codata)

### G0 constant

Conductance quantum constant. It is the quantized unit of electrical
conductance. It is required when measuring the conductance of a quantum
point contact, and also, it appears explicitly in the Landauer formula:

a quantum conductor to its quantum properties. It's an exact constant. [CODATA](#codata)

### G0F constant

Fermi reduced coupling constant. It is a fundamental physical constant
that represents the strength of the weak nuclear interaction, essentially
indicating how readily particles can interact via the weak force; a
larger value signifies a stronger interaction, and it is a key parameter
in the Standard Model of particle physics, primarily used to calculate
the decay rates of particles involved in weak interactions like beta
decay. It's a measured quantity. [CODATA](#codata)

### ø constant

Planck's constant `h` to the mass of the relevant particle `m`
chosen here as the electron. [CODATA](#codata)

### a0 constant

constant (`E=h·ν`), and the wavelength of a matter wave equals the Planck
constant divided by the associated particle momentum (`λ=h/p`). Since the 2019
SI redefinition, it has an exact value. [CODATA](#codata)

### ℏ constant

The reduced Planck constant, ℏ, also known as the Dirac Constant, is
exactly defined as `ℏ=h/2π`. [CODATA](#codata)

### α constant

Fine-structure constant. In physics, the fine-structure constant, also known as
the Sommerfeld constant, commonly denoted by α (the Greek letter alpha), is a
fundamental physical constant which quantifies the strength of the
electromagnetic interaction between elementary charged particles. It is measured
by observing the recoil frequency of atoms, like cesium or rubidium, when they
absorb a photon, essentially gauging how strongly the atoms recoil, which
provides an accurate determination of the constant's value using high precision
measurements achieved through techniques like matter-wave interferometry.

It is a dimensionless quantity, independent of the system of units used, which
is related to the strength of the coupling of an elementary charge `qe` with
the electromagnetic field. [CODATA](#codata)

### ΔfCs constant

hyperfine ground states of the caesium atom. The frequency `ΔfCs` of this

of exactly 9192631770 cycles of this radiation. It represents the "tick"

`G`. [CODATA](#codata)

of energy, which is theoretically meaningful within the framework of quantum
gravity, where both effects of quantum mechanics and general relativity
become significant; and also the energy scale at which the universe is thought
to have existed at times near the start of the Big Bang, characterized by
extremely high densities and temperatures. Its value depends on the measured
value of the gravitational constant `G`. [CODATA](#codata)
